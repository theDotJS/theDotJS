i mean I'm a huge pokemon fan

im a brazilian. here, and in almost every single other country that speaks the portuguese language, we refer the symbol . as "ponto." this was almost dot's name - but dot is way cooler than ponto. kinda strange that every main file of my projects is pronounced "dot dot js"? kinda. but is way better than "ponto dot js".
